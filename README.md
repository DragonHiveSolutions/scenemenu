# Scene Menu - Traffic Policer by Kye Jones
Simple script for FiveM allowing easier traffic control.

This resource allows players to easily and effectively manage the traffic around them. Place barriers, cones and more to stop traffic in the area.

With massive configuration support, you can easily add objects and manage who can use the menu or simply allow everyone to! This resource has been tried and tested in nearly every FiveM server in one way or another these days, and it’s the best option out there for traffic management. Whether you’re a police officer at a collision with traffic blaring past, or you’re doing roadworks on Joshua Road, this menu will be your best friend.

## Features:

- Object Spawner
- Working scene lights.

## Bugs/Issues:
